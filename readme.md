## Inroduction
Hello, World! I'm a student learning programming.
It's only been a month since I returned to school.
So the thing I learn are unfamiliar.

I'm intersted in making game. 
One of my school life goal is making a indie game alone.

## Carrers
* YeungNam Univ : School of Computer Science and Engineering : Major of Information & Communication Engineering
* And... No more carrer. Not yet, because I'm just a student.
* But someday, I'll have a carrer too.
