## Inroduction
* Hello, World! I'm a student learning programming.
* It's only been a month since I returned to school.
So the thing I learn are unfamiliar, but I will study hard.

* I'm interested in making game. 
* One of my goals in school is create an indie game on my own.
It might be very difficult, but I think it's possible with AI.

## Carrers
* YeungNam Univ : School of Computer Science and Engineering : Major of Information & Communication Engineering
* And... No more carrer. Not yet, because I'm just a student.
* But someday, I'll have a carrer too.
